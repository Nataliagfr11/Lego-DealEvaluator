## List of visual aspects convictions
Layout: Two-column layout with left for deals and right for filters/info, inspired by e-commerce UIs.

Color choice: LEGO theme colors — red, yellow, and blue — to align with the brand and ensure fun + readability.

Font choice: Sans-serif font for simplicity and modern feel.

Icons: Clear emojis for favorite (💛), discount (🔥), comments (💬), and publication date (📅) — engaging and universal.

## List of interaction patterns convictions
Dropdown selects for page and LEGO set selection — better UX for small screen and many options.

Clickable filter tags — easier and faster than radio buttons or checkboxes for this kind of use-case.

Favorite button toggle (💛 vs 🤍) — gives direct visual feedback and personalization.
